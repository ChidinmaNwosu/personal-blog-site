     <h2>My Journey and Goals as a New Frontend Developer</h2>
     <p>Hello! My name is Chidinma, and I'm excited to share my journey and aspirations in the tech world.<br/>
         Just recently, I ventured into the fascinating realm of frontend development, and it's been an exhilarating ride so far. <br/>
        Let me take you through my goals for the next two years and why I find this journey so thrilling.</p>

        <h3>
            My Journey So Far
        </h3>
        <p>Starting out in tech can be overwhelming, but it&apos;s also incredibly rewarding. <br>
            From the moment I wrote my first HTML tag to now building interactive user interfaces, I&apos;ve learned a lot and grown immensely.<br/>
            Frontend development allows me to combine my creativity with technical skills, creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.<br/>
            Each line of code feels like a step toward making the digital world more accessible and enjoyable.</p>

            <h4>Goals for the Next Two Years</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Mastering Frontend Technologies:
                    <p>
                        My first goal is to master the core technologies that form the backbone of frontend development.<br/>
                        This includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I want to build a solid foundation in these languages, <br/>
                        ensuring I can create responsive, efficient, and visually appealing web applications.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Building a Strong Portfolio:
                    <p>
                        A strong portfolio is crucial for any developer. Over the next two years, <br/>
                        I plan to work on various projects, both personal and collaborative, to showcase my skills.<br/>
                         These projects will range from simple websites to complex web applications,<br/>
                          highlighting my ability to solve real-world problems through code.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Contributing to Open Source:
                    <p>
                        Open-source contributions are a great way to give back to the community and learn from other experienced developers.<br/>
                         I aim to contribute to open-source projects regularly. <br/>
                        This will not only improve my coding skills but also allow me to collaborate with a diverse group of developers from around the world.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learning Backend Development:
                    <p>
                        While my primary focus is on frontend development, I believe having a basic understanding of backend technologies is crucial. <br/>
                        I plan to learn about server-side languages such as Node.js and Python, as well as databases like MongoDB and SQL.<br/>
                         This knowledge will help me become a more versatile developer, capable of understanding and building full-stack applications.
                         </p>

                    Improving Soft Skills:
                    <p>
                        Technical skills are essential, but soft skills are equally important. <br/>
                        I aim to improve my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.<br/>
                       These are crucial for collaborating with others, whether in a team setting or within the broader tech community.
                    </p>
                <li>
                    Staying Updated with Industry Trends:
                    <p>
                        The tech industry is constantly evolving, with new tools and best practices emerging regularly.<br/>
                         I plan to stay updated with the latest trends and continuously learn through online courses, tutorials, and attending tech meetups and conferences.
